Product-level analysis on WTO negotiating groups

## General Notion
- Profiling of each negotating group might be hard to tell if we just simply say "general" or "agriculture".
  - For example, `G-33`, a.k.a. `Freinds of Special Products” in agriculture` but hard to tell which agricultural product reside in the core of this coalition? 

- We can presumably think big group like `G-90` might contain superset of products compared to its subset group - `ACP`, `African Group` or `LDC`  

## Methodological Benefit
- Maybe Group level profiling of product-group might be possible for human as well, however, relative difference - which realtive difference is key to successfully determine the 

## Planning of Experiment
- Choose looks-like-most-different two groups

## Expected Functionality of The Research
- Provide analytic solution for the Deadlock in Multilateral Negotiation
